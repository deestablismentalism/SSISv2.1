4-Day MVP: Hybrid Report Card Verification System (PHP + JS + Python OCR)

OBJECTIVE:
Build a minimal but functional enrollment document verifier using PHP + JS + Python OCR that can automatically detect most wrong/mismatched report card uploads and only send flagged submissions to teachers for manual review.

This is an MVP focusing on speed and core function, not perfect OCR, not beautiful UI, and not complete features. Only what is needed to work.

🚀 SCOPE LIMITED TO 4 DAYS — WHAT MUST BE BUILT

Build ONLY the following:

1. PHP Upload Handler (CORE)

Accept form submission

Save uploaded report card image

Call Python script for OCR

Compare OCR results with submitted LRN and name

Decide:

Auto-approve

Flag for review

Save result in DB

Keep code simple. No frameworks.

2. Python OCR Script (CORE)

Use Tesseract ONLY.

Must do:

Read the uploaded image

Extract:

LRN (12 digits)

Grade-like numbers (75–100)

Basic keywords (“Quarter”, “Grade”, “Filipino”, etc.)

Perform simple quality checks:

Word count

Number of grades detected

Return JSON like:

{
  "lrn": "900000000144",
  "grades_found": 8,
  "word_count": 120,
  "flags": []
}


If suspicious:

{
  "flags": ["no_grades","low_text"]
}


NO complex extraction, no table detection, no advanced AI.

3. Basic PHP Auto-Approval Logic (CORE)

Auto-approve ONLY if:

OCR finds LRN

LRN matches the submitted LRN

At least 5 grade-like numbers detected

Word count ≥ 50

No critical flags from Python

Otherwise → set status = “flagged_for_review”.

4. Simple Teacher Review Dashboard (MVP)

A single minimal HTML/PHP page:

List all submissions

Show:

Uploaded report card (image)

Submitted form data

OCR results

Flags

Buttons:

Approve

Reject

Request re-upload

No fancy styling, just functional.

🟥 WHAT MUST NOT BE BUILT (OUT OF SCOPE)

To fit the 4-day deadline, DO NOT build:

❌ advanced ML document detection
❌ subject row parsing
❌ fancy UI (just simple HTML tables)
❌ rotation correction
❌ blur detection
❌ QR validation
❌ name fuzzy matching
❌ multi-image pages
❌ field-level accuracy scoring
❌ user accounts / roles (optional admin login only)
❌ file format conversions
❌ mobile optimization

ONLY build enough to have a working pipeline.

🟩 MINIMUM DATABASE DESIGN

Create ONLY the essential fields:

submissions table:

id

student_name

student_lrn

report_card_path

ocr_json (text)

status (“approved”, “flagged”, “pending_review”, “reupload_needed”)

created_at

updated_at

No need for normalized tables or relations for MVP.

🟦 WORKFLOW (WHAT THE CODE MUST IMPLEMENT)

Parent submits form + report card

PHP saves image

PHP runs Python OCR script

Python extracts minimal info

Python outputs JSON

PHP reads JSON

PHP applies simple logic:

If LRN matches AND grades found ≥5 → auto-approve

Else → flag for review

Teacher dashboard shows flagged submissions

Teacher manually approves/rejects

This is all that needs to work.

🛠️ REQUIRED OUTPUTS FROM THE AI (KEEP THEM SIMPLE)

AI must generate:

✔️ validate_card.py

Tesseract OCR

Basic regex extraction

Word count

Grades count

Minimal flags

✔️ PHP upload handler

Save file

Call Python

Parse JSON

Apply approval logic

Insert into DB

✔️ Simple admin dashboard

Table of submissions

Basic detail page

Approve/Reject/Request re-upload

✔️ Minimal CSS

ONLY enough to not look broken.

✔️ Instructions:

How to install Tesseract

How to run Python script from PHP

Folder structure

⚡ FINAL INSTRUCTION TO THE AI

Generate ONLY the features stated above, nothing more.
Everything must be achievable in 4 days by one developer.
Keep the system minimal, functional, and simple.
Focus on working code, not polished code.
